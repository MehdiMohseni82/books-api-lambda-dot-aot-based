## Prepare to Implement Lambda via .NET

Follow these steps to set up your .NET environment for implementing AWS Lambda functions. For more details, refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/csharp-package-cli.html).

### Install Lambda Templates

This command installs the AWS Lambda templates, providing a starting point for creating Lambda functions in .NET.

```bash
dotnet new install Amazon.Lambda.Templates
```

### Install Lambda Tools

Installs the AWS Lambda .NET CLI tool, which helps deploy and manage Lambda functions.

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

### List Available Templates

Lists all the installed .NET templates, including the AWS Lambda templates.

```bash
dotnet new list
```

### Create New Lambda Function

Creates a new AWS Lambda function project using the Native AOT template, which optimizes for performance and reduces cold start times.

```bash
dotnet new lambda.NativeAOT -o test-aot-lambda
```

## Compiling with Native AOT

To compile and publish your project using the Native AOT toolchain, add the ILCompiler package reference to your project. Ensure your `nuget.config` is updated with the necessary package sources. Use the following commands:

### Add ILCompiler Package

```bash
dotnet new nugetconfig
```

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler -v 8.*
```

### Compile and Publish

```bash
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release
```

### Cross-Architecture Compilation

Add the following to your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler; runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler" Version="8.*" />
```

Compile for Linux ARM64:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-arm64
```

## Why Use Linux ARM64 Architecture for Lambda Functions?

Using Linux ARM64 architecture for Lambda functions provides several benefits:

- **Cost Efficiency:** ARM64 instances are generally more cost-effective compared to their x86 counterparts.
- **Performance:** ARM64 architecture offers competitive performance for compute-intensive tasks.
- **Power Efficiency:** ARM64 CPUs are designed to be more power-efficient, which can be beneficial for certain workloads.

Since most of our development machines use x86_64 architecture, cross-platform compilation is necessary to build and deploy Lambda functions on ARM64 architecture.
